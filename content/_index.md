Welcome to Atom-Haskell documentation site.

Information collected on these pages should help you get started with Haskell in Atom editor.

At the moment, this site mostly only collects information from various Atom-Haskell project READMEs. Proper documentation/tutorials are work-in-progress.

Click one of the links on the left to start reading.

## IRC Chat

You can join #atom-haskell on FreeNode, and devs can usually be found there. Bear in mind that if someone's on the channel, it doesn't necessarily mean they aren't AFK.

If you're not familiar with IRC, you can use [FreeNode's webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#atom-haskell)

## Gitter Chat

We also have a Gitter chat room on https://gitter.im/atom-haskell/ide-haskell
